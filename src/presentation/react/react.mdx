#### JavaScript Frameworks

> **Angular is what you get if you think the biggest problem with writing webapps is that Javascript isn't Java; Ember that it's not Ruby.** (I kid. But I'm less familiar with those frameworks.) And so on. Everyone has their own ideas of what's hard to solve.

#### JavaScript Frameworks

- **Why do frameworks exist?**
  - Keep state out of the DOM
  - Higher-level abstractions
  - Code organization
- **Pros**
  - Common concepts that can be shared between apps and developers
  - Large communities, shared knowledge, documentation, bug fixes
  - Better app structure through tools and guidelines
- **Cons**
  - Learning curve
  - Minimum requirements for size
  - Setup and infrastructure

#### What is React?


<Image src={reactLogo} />


- "A Javascript library for creating user interfaces"
- "The 'V' in 'MVC'"
- "A library, not a framework"

#### What Is React?

##### Declarative

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug

##### Component-Based

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

import jQueryImperative from './examples/jQuery';
import reactDeclarative from './examples/react';

#### Declarative Code 

<Layout  style={{flexWrap : "wrap"}}>
    <Fill style={{marginRight : 5, minWidth: 700}}>
        <Heading size={5}>Imperative</Heading>
        <CodePane lang="js" source={jQueryImperative} />
    </Fill>
    <Fill style={{marginLeft : 5}}>
        
        <Heading size={5}>Declarative</Heading>
        <CodePane lang="js" source={reactDeclarative} />
    </Fill>
</Layout>

- React is an abstraction away from the DOM
- Encourages you to think of your application and UI in terms of ***state***, rather than explicit UI manipulations
- Allows a simplified mental model for data flow: "re-render the whole app on every update"
- Mix and match reusable components to build UIs

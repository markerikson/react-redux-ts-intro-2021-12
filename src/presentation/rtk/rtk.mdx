#### Redux Toolkit

- Common complaints about Redux:
  - Configuring a Redux store is too complicated
  - Have to add a lot of packages to do anything useful (`redux-thunk`, `reselect`, etc)
  - Too easy to accidentally make a mistake like mutating state
  - Amount of "boilerplate" you need to write (see [Issue #2295](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/2295) for discussion)
    - Action types
    - Action creators
    - Immutable update logic
    - "Have" to use multiple files
    - Complex store setup process

---

#### Redux Toolkit

- Created a new official package called **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)**, inspired by
  `create-react-app` and `apollo-boost`.
- Goals:
  - Simplify common Redux use cases
  - Provide good opinionated defaults out of the box
  - Minimize the amount of code you have to write by hand
  - Doesn't "hide" that you're using Redux, just makes it easier
  - Opt-in - can add incrementally to an existing app, or use day 1 on a new project
  - Provide a great developer experience for TypeScript users
- Originally named "Redux Starter Kit", but renamed after 1.0 release
  - Confusion over "starter kit" naming: boilerplate? only good for beginners?
  - Renamed to "Redux Toolkit" (package: `@reduxjs/toolkit` ) for 1.0.4 release
- Written in TypeScript, designed to simplify TS usage patterns
- Most recent TS and API dev work thanks to co-maintainer Lenz Weber (`@phryneas`)

##### Useful for <i>all</i> Redux users, both new and experienced!

import configureStore from "./examples/configureStore";

#### Redux Toolkit: `configureStore()`

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={configureStore}
  leftStyle={{  }}
>{`
- A small wraper around the Redux \`createStore\` function:
  - Automatically sets up the Redux DevTools extension by default
  - Automatically adds \`redux-thunk\` by default, plus middleware to check for accidental mutations and non-serializable values
  - Accepts either a root reducer function, or an object of slice reducers and will automatically call \`combineReducers\` for you
  - Accepts middlewares and store enhancers as arrays, and composes them properly
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>


---

import configureStore2 from "./examples/configureStore2";

#### Redux Toolkit: `configureStore()`

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={configureStore2}
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 700 }}
>{`
- Options are passed as a "named arguments" object:
  - Override middleware list
  - Use an initial state
  - Enable/disable DevTools Extension
  - Provide additional store enhancers
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>


---

import immer from "./examples/immer";

#### Immer

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={immer}
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 700 }}
>{`
- An immutable update library from Michel Westrate (author of MobX)
  - Uses ES6 Proxies to let you "mutate" your data, but applies the changes immutably
  - Can drastically simplify your immutable update logic
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import createReducer from "./examples/createReducer";

#### Redux Toolkit: `createReducer()`

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={createReducer}
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 700 }}
>{`
- Accepts a lookup table of action types to reducer functions
- It uses Immer internally, so your reducers can "mutate" the state!
- **Warning:** this only works _if_ you are using the "magic" \`createReducer\` with Immer inside. Otherwise, these functions \`are\` mutating the state!
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>


---

import createAction from "./examples/createAction";

#### Redux Toolkit: `createAction()`

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={createAction}
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 700 }}
>{`
- Inspired by \`redux-actions\`
- Generates an action creator that uses the given type and accepts \`payload\` as an argument
- Action creator function overrides \`toString()\`, so it can be used as the "action type" itself where needed (also exposed as \`actionCreator.type\`)
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>


---

import createSlice from "./examples/createSlice";

#### Redux Toolkit: `createSlice()`

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={createSlice}
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 700 }}
>{`
- Inspired by Eric Elliott's \`autodux\` project
- Accepts an object of reducers, and returns auto-generated action creators, action types, and a reducer function
- Uses our "magic" \`createReducer\` utility, so that your reducers can "mutate" their state
- Makes it easy to use the "ducks" pattern (default export reducer, named export action creators)
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import createSlice2 from "./examples/createSlice2";

#### Redux Toolkit: `createSlice()`


<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={createSlice2}
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 700 }}
>{`
- Usage patterns:
  - Can handle other action types using \`extraReducers\`
  - Slices are just actions + reducers - write side effects like thunks separately and use the generated action creators, same as usual
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import createSelector from "./examples/createSelector";

#### Redux Toolkit: `createSelector()`

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={createSelector}
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 700 }}
>{`
- Re-exports the \`createSelector\` function from Reselect, for creating memoized selectors
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import createAsyncThunk from "./examples/createAsyncThunk";

#### Redux Toolkit: `createAsyncThunk()`

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={createAsyncThunk}
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 700 }}
>{`
- Standard async thunk pattern:
  - Dispatch "loading" action before fetch
  - Dispatch either "success" or "failure" action based on result
- \`createAsyncThunk\` implements that pattern:
  - Accepts an action type string prefix and a "payload creator" callback that returns a Promise
  - Autogenerates actions for \`pending\`, \`fulfilled\`, and \`rejected\` cases
  - Auto dispatches those actions based on promise resolution lifecycle
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>


---

import createEntityAdapter from "./examples/createEntityAdapter";

#### Redux Toolkit: `createEntityAdapter()`

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={createEntityAdapter}
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 700 }}
>{`
- Redux docs recommend "normalizing" state structure
  - Single copy of each item
  - Track items in an object mapping IDs to items
- \`createEntityAdapter\` implements that pattern:
  - Defines prebuilt reducers for common CRUD logic (add / update / delete, one/many)
  - Reducers can be used directly or as "mutating" helpers
  - Maintains IDs array, with optional sorting based on items
  - Generates basic set of selector functions (select all as array, one by ID, etc)
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

#### Redux Toolkit: Safety Checks

- Most common mistake with Redux: accidental mutations!
  - Can happen in a reducer, _or_ outside a reducer (`mapState`, etc)
  - Usually results in connected components not re-rendering, or bad data when debugging
  - _Really_ hard to figure out where this happened... or is it?

#### Redux Toolkit: Safety Checks

- Most common mistake with Redux: accidental mutations!
  - Can happen in a reducer, _or_ outside a reducer (`mapState`, etc)
  - Usually results in connected components not re-rendering, or bad data when debugging
  - _Really_ hard to figure out where this happened... or is it?
- Several existing "mutation detection" middleware available - the best one is `redux-immutable-state-invariant`
- Redux Toolkit's `configureStore()` adds a port of `redux-immutable-state-invariant` by default!
  - Throws an error when accidental mutations are detected
  - Tells you the state path where the mutation occurred
- RTK also adds a check for "non-serializable values" in state and actions by default
  - Created by me, modeled on the mutation check middleware

import rtkQueryExample from "./examples/rtkQuery";

#### Redux Toolkit: Roadmap

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={rtkQueryExample}
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 900 }}
>{`
- Current RTK version: 1.5.0
- New experimental API now available: [**RTK Query**](https://rtk-query-docs.netlify.app)
  - Advanced data fetching and caching library built for Redux Toolkit
  - Just released as alpha - will iterate on API, then merge into RTK

import { actionStackTraces } from "./imagesLoader";

#### Redux DevTools Extension

- History:
  - Original DevTools logic and component created by Dan Abramov
  - Turned into a browser extension by Mihail Diordiev and maintained separately
- New ["action stack traces"](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/blob/master/docs/Features/Trace.md) feature:
  - Allows viewing the complete stack trace for any dispatched action - no more digging through files to see where
    the dispatch actually occurred!
  - Reuses the stack trace components from `create-react-app`, including showing original source if available
  - Clicking source lines will open file in DevTools debugger or your preferred editor
  - Prototyped by me, polished and merged by Mihail Diordiev
  - _Not_ enabled by default - need to call `composeWithDevTools({trace : true})`
  - RTK's `configureStore` does turn this on automatically

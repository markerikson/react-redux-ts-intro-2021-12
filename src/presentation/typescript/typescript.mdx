#### TypeScript

- Sales pitch:
  - "JavaScript, with static types on top"
  - "All JavaScript is valid TypeScript" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜œ
- Overview:
  - Standalone compiler that compiles TS syntax to various flavors of ES, with compile-time type-checking
    - Can also be parsed by Babel, but without type-checking
  - Language aimed to be a superset of current JS (ES20xx, + stage 3 features)
  - Created by Microsoft (author of C#)
  - Open-source, but developed by an Microsoft-led team
  - Rapid adoption over last 5 years (some surveys indicate >40% industry usage in newer apps)

#### Why Use TypeScript?

- **Documentation**: static types tell devs what variables look like quickly - especially valuable when working with unfamiliar code
- **Compile-time errors**: common issues like typos or undefined values can be caught immediately, rather than at runtime; compiler prevents passing invalid values
- **Intellisense**: type declarations allow IDEs to provide proper autocompletion and type information when writing code
- **Refactoring**: can confidently rename / delete / extract code, rather than searching and "hope I found all the uses"
- **Long-term maintainability**: better codebase information for future developers who may rotate on and off the project
- **Code Quality**: doesn't replace unit tests, but can help minimize errors
- **Library Support**: most common 3rd-party libs either ship typings, or community has created their own

---

#### Downsides of Using TypeScript

- **Learning Curve**: additional syntax and concepts take time to understand, _on top of_ knowing plain JS by itself
- **Time to Write Code**: literally more code to write out than just plain JS
- **Difficulties Typing Dynamic JS**: can be difficult to come up with good static types for highly dynamic JS behavior
- **Inconsistent/Missing Library Types**: not all libs have typings, and quality can vary
- **Compilation Time**: TS usage can slow down build times
- **Over-Emphasis on Type Coverage**: some TS users spend too much time trying to achieve "100% perfect static type coverage" of an entire codebase, leading to bizarrely complex types

#### TypeScript: Using Libraries

- Libraries may include an `index.d.ts` file containing type declarations
  - Allows TS compiler to know what types the library exports
  - Could be written by hand, or generated by TS compiler
- Many libraries ship their own typings
- Community maintains 3rd-party library typing file declarations in the [DefinitelyTyped repo](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)
- 3rd-party library typings can be installed from the `@types` namespace on NPM:
  - `npm i react @types/react`
- If a library has no types, or the types are inaccurate, you can create your own custom typings file for that library:
  - Could just mock it out with `any`
  - Could try to declare sort-of accurate types

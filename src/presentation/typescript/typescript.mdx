#### TypeScript

- Sales pitch:
  - "JavaScript, with static types on top"
  - "All JavaScript is valid TypeScript" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜œ
- Overview:
  - Standalone compiler that compiles TS syntax to various flavors of ES, with compile-time type-checking
    - Can also be parsed by Babel, but without type-checking
  - Language aimed to be a superset of current JS (ES20xx, + stage 3 features)
  - Created by Microsoft (author of C#)
  - Open-source, but developed by an Microsoft-led team
  - Rapid adoption over last 5 years (some surveys indicate >40% industry usage in newer apps)

---

#### Why Use TypeScript?

- **Documentation**: static types tell devs what variables look like quickly - especially valuable when working with unfamiliar code
- **Compile-time errors**: common issues like typos or undefined values can be caught immediately, rather than at runtime; compiler prevents passing invalid values
- **Intellisense**: type declarations allow IDEs to provide proper autocompletion and type information when writing code
- **Refactoring**: can confidently rename / delete / extract code, rather than searching and "hope I found all the uses"
- **Long-term maintainability**: better codebase information for future developers who may rotate on and off the project
- **Code Quality**: doesn't replace unit tests, but can help minimize errors
- **Library Support**: most common 3rd-party libs either ship typings, or community has created their own

---

#### Downsides of Using TypeScript

- **Learning Curve**: additional syntax and concepts take time to understand, _on top of_ knowing plain JS by itself
- **Time to Write Code**: literally more code to write out than just plain JS
- **Difficulties Typing Dynamic JS**: can be difficult to come up with good static types for highly dynamic JS behavior
- **Inconsistent/Missing Library Types**: not all libs have typings, and quality can vary
- **Compilation Time**: TS usage can slow down build times
- **Over-Emphasis on Type Coverage**: some TS users spend too much time trying to achieve "100% perfect static type coverage" of an entire codebase, leading to bizarrely complex types

#### TypeScript Usage Tips

- Goal: **"80% sweet spot" of type coverage!**
  - See "Lessons and Takeaways" section in Mark's post [**Learning and Using TS as an App Dev and Lib Maintainer**](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2019/11/blogged-answers-learning-and-using-typescript/#lessons-opinions-and-takeaways)
  - Want correct types, but not wasted effort
- Aim to type: function arguments / return values, React component props and state, API responses, Redux state
- Infer values as much as possible - don't insist on declaring types for _every_ variable!
  - Sometimes may want to declare function return types instead of inferring, just to be sure they're correct or catch errors
- Avoid use of `any` and `// @ts-ignore`... _unless_ absolutely necessary
  - valid escape hatches, but they're a last resort
- On the other hand, prefer using these escape hatches instead of wasting hours fighting TS compiler
  - You know what the code does - sometimes hard to convince the compiler you're right
  - Can use a type like `type $FixTypeLater = any` as a placeholder

import reactExample1 from "./examples/ReactExample1";

#### Typing React Components

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={reactExample1}
  language="typescript"
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 850 }}
>{`
- [Read and follow the React TypeScript Cheatsheet!](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react)
- Declare interfaces for React props
- Infer or declare types for \`useState\`
- Declare types for event handlers if declaring separately
- \`React.ReactNode\`: JSX element, string, number, null
- \`React.CSSProperties\`: type for \`style\` prop
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import reduxExample1 from "./examples/ReduxExample1";

#### Typing Redux

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={reduxExample1}
  language="typescript"
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 750 }}
>{`
- [Read and follow the Redux Toolkit "Usage with TS" docs](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/usage-with-typescript)
- Declare data types in slice files
- Declare types of initial state for slices
- Declare type of actions in reducers as \`PayloadAction<TypeOfPayloadHere>\`
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

import reduxExample2 from "./examples/ReduxExample2";

#### Typing React-Redux

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={reduxExample2}
  language="typescript"
  leftStyle={{ minWidth: 850 }}
>{`
- Declare \`(state: RootState)\` as arg in selector functions
- May need to declare \`const dispatch : AppDispatch = useDispatch()\` in components to be able to dispatch thunks properly
  - Note: Can define pre-typed versions of both of these hooks, then import those pre-typed hooks everywhere - see [React-Redux "Usage with TS" docs page](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/static-typing)
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

#### TypeScript: Using Libraries

- Libraries may include an `index.d.ts` file containing type declarations
  - Allows TS compiler to know what types the library exports
  - Could be written by hand, or generated by TS compiler
- Many libraries ship their own typings
- Community maintains 3rd-party library typing file declarations in the [DefinitelyTyped repo](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)
- 3rd-party library typings can be installed from the `@types` namespace on NPM:
  - `npm i react @types/react`
- If a library has no types, or the types are inaccurate, you can create your own custom typings file for that library:
  - Could just mock it out with `any`
  - Could try to declare sort-of accurate types

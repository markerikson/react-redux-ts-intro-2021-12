#### React-Redux

- Since Redux is UI-framework agnostic, need a "bindings" library to integrate with a given UI layer
- React-Redux provides bindings to let React components interact with the Redux store
- Only UI bindings library maintained by the Redux team

##### Mark's Dev Blog: <br /> **[The History and Implementation of React-Redux](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2018/11/react-redux-history-implementation/)**

- Integrating Redux with a UI
  - What does React-Redux even do for you, and why do we need "UI bindings" in the first place?
  - How does it work internally?
- Development History of the React-Redux API
  - Initial design constraints
  - API and implementation changes over time

---

#### React-Redux v7

- Goals:
  - v6 architecture tried to use context for state propagation, which had performance problems
  - Switch back to per-component Redux store subscriptions for better performance
  - Enable future implementation of a React-Redux hooks API
- Behavior and implementation:
  - Rewrote `connect` using React hooks API + internal Redux store subscriptions
  - Used React renderer batching from ReactDOM and React Native
  - Released in spring 2019

---

#### React-Redux v7.1: Hooks!

- Goal: eventually design and ship a public `useRedux()`-type hooks API
  - Bikeshedding issue thread: [Issue #1179: Discussion: Potential Hooks API Design](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1179)
  - Extensive discussions around potential API designs and implementation constraints
- Behavior and implementation:
  - Settled on two primary hooks: `useSelector` and `useDispatch`
  - Unlike `connect`, cannot enforce top-down nested subscriptions
  - Reference (`===`) equality checks for selectors instead of shallow equality
  - No action creator binding
  - No automatic wrapping of components to avoid re-renders
- **We now recommend using the hooks API as the default approach**
  - `connect` is supported indefinitely, but no plans for further changes
- The hooks API has a different set of tradeoffs than `connect` does:

import useSelector from "./examples/useSelector";

#### React-Redux: `useSelector()`

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={useSelector}>{`
- Extracts a value from the Redux state for use in this component
  - Accepts a "selector" function as its argument
  - Subscribes to the store and re-runs the selector whenever the store state changes
- Differences from \`connect\` and \`mapState\`:
  - Uses reference equality by default (also takes an optional equality comparison argument)
  - Can be called multiple times in one component
  - Don't have to return an object (and should prefer returning single values)
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import useDispatch from "./examples/useDispatch";

#### React-Redux: `useDispatch()`

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={useDispatch}>{`
- Returns the store's \`dispatch\` method
- Differences from \`connect\` and \`mapDispatch\`:
  - Equivalent to calling \`connect\` with no \`mapDispatch\` argument
  - No "binding action creators" any more - up to you to call \`dispatch()\` in your own handlers
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import provider from "./examples/Provider";

#### React-Redux: `<Provider>`

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={provider}>{`
- Makes the Redux store accessible to all components in the app
- Should be set up in app entry point file, and wrap entire app component
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

## React Components

#### Components

##### Components === State Machines

React thinks of UIs as simple state machines. By thinking of a UI as being in various states and rendering those states, it's easy to keep your UI consistent. In React, you simply update a component's state, and then render a new UI based on this new state. React takes care of updating the DOM for you in the most efficient way

##### Components === Functions

Just like functions take parameters and return a result, components take in values and return UI output. Given the same input values, a component will return the same UI output. This is often described as `UI = f(state)`

import helloWorld from "./examples/HelloWorldComponent";

#### Hello World Component

<ComponentPlayground code={helloWorld} />

import functionComponents from "./examples/FunctionComponents";
import classComponents from "./examples/ClassComponents";

#### Declaring Components

<Layout style={{ flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <Fill style={{ marginRight: 5 }}>
    <Heading textColor="tertiary" size={6}>
      Function Components (modern)
    </Heading>
    <CodePane lang="jsx" source={functionComponents} />
  </Fill>
  <Fill style={{ marginLeft: 5 }}>
    <Heading textColor="tertiary" size={6}>
      Class Components (legacy)
    </Heading>
    <CodePane lang="javascript" source={classComponents} />
  </Fill>
</Layout>

import renderExample from "./examples/RenderExample";

#### Basic Usage

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={renderExample}>{`
- A React function component will be called by React. This process is known as
  **"rendering"**
- When a component renders, it returns a tree of React
  component descriptions, which will eventually be turned into DOM nodes in the
  page
- The \`ReactDOM.render()\` method creates a new component tree,
  initializes the React library, and appends the generated DOM output from the
  component and its children to the parent DOM node
  `}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import jsxExample1 from "./examples/JsxExample";

#### JSX Syntax

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={jsxExample1}>{`
- JSX is syntax sugar for nested function calls. Not required to use React, but the standard approach. Requires compilation process, usually with Babel.
- JSX "tags" are turned into \`React.createElement()\` calls (which could be written by hand without JSX). Those calls return plain JS objects describing the output. 
- React "element" objects look like: \`{type : thingToRender, props : {}, children : []}\`
  `}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import jsxExample2 from "./examples/JsxExample2";

#### JSX Syntax

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={jsxExample2} leftStyle={{ maxWidth: 700 }}>{`
- Curly braces "escape" from JSX back into normal JS expressions. They are used to insert values from variables and comment out code
- A few attribute names differ from plain HTML. In particular, use \`className\` instead of \`class\` for HTML/CSS class values, and \`<label htmlFor="someInput">\`.
- Render logic can return a single root element, an array, a string, or a number
- To return multiple items, use \`<React.Fragment>\` as a pseudo "parent" (which will not add any extra DOM nodes around the content)
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import jsxExample2 from "./examples/JsxExample2";

#### JSX Gotchas

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={jsxExample2} leftStyle={{ maxWidth: 700 }}>{`
- JSX uses capitalization to differentiate between HTML elements and React components. 
- If the first letter is lowercase, the tag is assumed to be an HTML element, and turned into a string. If it's uppercase, the tag is assumed to be a variable name in scope (usually a component).
- A common mistake is to give a variable a camelcase name and render it, like \`<myComponent>\`. React turns that into \`{type : "myComponent"}\`, which breaks, instead of \`{type : MyComponent}\`.)
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

#### "Separation of Concerns"?

> Templates encourage a poor separation of concerns. "View Model" tightly couples a template to display logic. Display logic and markup are inevitably tightly coupled. **Templates separate technologies, not concerns**.

> <br />
>
> React components are **"...a highly cohesive building block for UIs loosely coupled with other components."**

#### Passing Data As Props

<ComponentPlayground code={propsExample} />

import propsExampleAgain from "./examples/PropsExample";

#### Component Props

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={propsExampleAgain}
  leftStyle={{ maxWidth: 700 }}
>{`
- **Props** are values passed from parent to child. Think of them as arguments being passed into a function (which is actually the case!)
- Props are combined into a single object. That \`props\` object is the only parameter for function components. (For class components, it's available as \`this.props\` .)
- Props are **read-only** inside of a component, in the same way that a plain function should not modify its arguments.
- Anything can be passed as a prop: primitives, objects, arrays, functions, component types, JSX elements, and more.

#### React Events - Deja Vu?

<LeftContentRightMarkdown
  leftContent={
    <div>
      <Image src={iamdeveloperOnclick} />
      <CodePane source={basicEventHandlerExample} lang="jsx" />
    </div>
  }
>{`
- React manages event handling internally. 
  - Event handlers declared in a component are automatically managed by React, using "event delegation" to simplify handling and improve performance. 
  - It also normalizes event behavior across browsers.
- React components create event handler callbacks and pass _references_ to those callbacks as props to child components.
- Event handler prop names are \`camelCased\`: \`onClick\`, \`onMouseMove\`

import useStateExample from "./examples/UseStateExample";

#### Component State: The `useState` Hook

<ComponentPlayground code={useStateExample} />

---

import useStateExplained from "./examples/UseStateExplained";

#### Component State: The `useState` Hook

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={useStateExplained}>{`
- **Hooks** allow React function components to have internal state and run additional logic after rendering
- The **\`useState\`** hook allows components to store and update a value internally
  - \`useState\` accepts an _initial_ state value, and returns an array with 2 things inside: the _current_ value, and a setter function
  - Calling \`setState(newValue)\` will queue a re-render with the new value
- Normally use ES6 "array destructuring" to read the two values into local variables, using whatever names you want for them
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import useStateExplained2 from "./examples/UseStateExplained2";

#### Component State: The `useState` Hook

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={useStateExplained2}>{`
- Can call \`useState\` many times in one component
- Calling \`setState()\` replaces existing value
  - Can have objects instead of primitives, but you must create a new object immutably and pass it in yourself
- \`setState()\` always requires a new value by reference
  - If the value passed to \`setState\` hasn't changed, React will skip the re-render
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import useStateExplained3 from "./examples/UseStateExplained3";

#### Component State: `useState` Tips

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={useStateExplained3}
  leftStyle={{ maxWidth: 700 }}
>{`
- Creating callbacks "closes over" variable values at time of render
  - Can cause bugs due to "stale state" if not careful!
- Be careful with multiple update calls in a row!
- \`setState\` can accept an "updater" callback instead of a value.
  - Updater will be called with the latest value as its argument, and should return a new value. Safer to use this if multiple updates depend on each other
  - Also can avoid having to capture value from parent scope
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import listsExample from "./examples/ListsExample";

#### Rendering Lists

<ComponentPlayground code={listsExample} />

- List items must have **keys**, which tell React list item identity
  - Should be unique per list
  - Ideally, use item IDs
  - Fallback, use array indices, but only if data won't reorder

import { ryanflorenceJustJS } from "./imagesLoader";

#### It's Just JavaScript

<LeftContentRightMarkdown
  leftContent={
    <div>
      <Image src={ryanflorenceJustJS} />
    </div>
  }
>{`
- JSX looks like HTML, but is converted to plain JS function calls
- No special "template syntax" for looping or conditions - use normal JS logic and syntax!
  - Conditional rendering: \`if/else\`, ternary operator
  - Looping: \`array.map()\`, \`for\` 
`}</LeftContentRightMarkdown>

---

import renderLogicExample from "./examples/RenderLogicExample";

#### Render Logic

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown
  leftSource={renderLogicExample}
  leftStyle={{ maxWidth: 750 }}
>{`
- Render methods can contain arbitrary logic. Different people structure their render methods in different ways. Many use inline logic in their JSX structures, including ternary statements and array mappings.
- My preferred approach for rendering is to keep all logic outside of the main JSX structure, for clarity
- Render logic must be "**pure**", without any "side effects"
  - No AJAX calls, mutating data, random values
  - **Rendering should only be based on current props and state**
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import parentChildExample from "./examples/ParentChildExample";

#### Parent/Child Communication

<ComponentPlayground code={parentChildExample} />

- Parents pass data as props to children
- Parents pass callbacks to children as props, children communicate to parent by running `props.somethingHappened(data)`

---

import useEffectExample1 from "./examples/UseEffectExample1";

#### Component Effects: The `useEffect` Hook

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={useEffectExample1}>{`
- Component render logic is not allowed to contain side effects
- Components can run additional logic that _can_ have side effects, _after_ the rendering is done
- The **\`useEffect\`** hook allows components to run logic that has side effects
- By default, \`useEffect\` runs its callback after _every_ render
  - Effects run on brief timeout after render is complete
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import useEffectExample2 from "./examples/UseEffectExample2";

#### Component Effects: The `useEffect` Hook

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={useEffectExample2}>{`
- Effect callbacks can return a cleanup function
  - Typical example: subscribe to an event, then unsubscribe in cleanup
  - Cleanup function will run before unmount, but also if effect re-runs
- Effect hook accepts a "dependencies array" argument to limit when the effect callback runs
- Concept: "What state does this effect sync with?"
  - \`useEffect(fn)\`: "all state" (run callback after every render)
  - \`useEffect(fn, [])\`: "all state" (only run callback on mount)
  - \`useEffect(fn, [value1, value2])\`: "these values" (run on mount, and when any value changes)
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

#### Rules of Hooks

All React hooks usage **must** follow two important rules!

- **Only call hooks at the top level of a function component**
  - May not call hooks inside conditional logic, loops, or nested functions
  - Reason: React needs to track exact order of hooks used, and that order must match every time a function component is rendered
- **Do not call hooks outside of React function components**
  - Do not call hooks in plain JS (non-component) functions
  - May call hooks inside of "custom hooks", but those must also follow hooks rules when used

React "Rules of Hooks" ESLint plugin warns about these - do what it says!

(Note: some hooks data dependency issues can be tricky to solve)

---

import customHooksExample1 from "./examples/CustomHooks1";

#### Custom Hooks

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={customHooksExample1}>{`
- Need some way to share and reuse logic between components
  - If writing normal JS code, just "extract a function"
- Can do the same thing with hooks-related code
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import customHooksExample2 from "./examples/CustomHooks2";

#### Custom Hooks

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={customHooksExample2}>{`
- Can extract hooks-related code into a new "custom hook" function
- Just a function that calls React hooks
- Name must start with \`use\`
- Many React libraries now ship their own custom hooks
  - React-Redux: \`useSelector\`, \`useDispatch\`
  - React-Router: \`useHistory\`, \`useLocation\`, \`useParams\`
  - Others: \`useClickOutside\`, \`useWindowSize\`, \`useFormState\`, etc
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import otherHooksExample from "./examples/OtherHooksExample";

#### Other Built-In Hooks

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown leftSource={otherHooksExample}>{`
- \`useLayoutEffect(fn, deps)\`
  - same as \`useEffect\`, but runs callback synchronously during commit phase
- \`useMemo(fn, deps)\`
  - recalculates value when deps change
- \`useCallback(fn, deps)\`
  - updates callback function reference when deps change
- \`useRef()\`
  - provides a mutable "ref object" that persists between renders
  - Object is \`{current: null}\`
  - Used as "instance variable", or access to DOM nodes
  - Plain object, so mutating \`.current\` doesn't trigger re-renders!
`}</LeftCodeRightMarkdown>

---

import refsExample from "./examples/RefsExample";

#### Access DOM Nodes with Refs

<ComponentPlayground code={refsExample} />

- Pass a ref object as `<element ref={refObj}>`
- `refObj.current` will be the real DOM node after render is done
- Escape hatch - use sparingly!

---

import controlledInputs1 from "./examples/ControlledInputs1";

#### Forms and Controlled Inputs

<ComponentPlayground code={controlledInputs1} />

---

#### Forms and Controlled Inputs

- Browsers normally own and update input state based on user interaction
  - React wants to own updating DOM based on state
- React uses "controlled inputs" as the idiomatic form input technique
  - React forces inputs to have values based on state
  - Useful for validating data immediately
  - Can still use "uncontrolled" inputs if desired
- "Controlled inputs" must have:
  - `value` prop (or equivalent, like `checked` for checkboxes)
  - `onChange` callback that reads event and updates state
- Sequence:
  - React applies `value` to input
  - User edits input
  - Browser triggers change event
  - App code takes _proposed_ new value from event, sets state with new value
  - React re-renders and applies `value` to input
- Tips:
  - Can use `input.name` prop -> `e.target.name` field as a generic key to update fields in an object
  - Some inputs like checkboxes have other value field, like `checked`

#### Styling Components

<LeftCodeRightMarkdown

  leftStyle={{ maxWidth: 700 }}
>{`
Multiple options available for styling React components, including:
  
- Inline styles (\`style\` prop):
  - Applies styles directly to that element, high importance
  - Style objects have \`camelCased\` properties, unlike CSS
- Normal CSS classnames
  - Write CSS, hand-write class names
  - Common to use the \`classnames()\` util to conditionally combine multiple classnames into one string
  - Use \`className\` prop in JSX, not \`class\`!
- CSS Modules:
  - Build-time conversion of simple CSS file classnames to globally-unique classnames (\`.label\` -> \`"StylingExample_label-a841b7"\`)
  - Import CSS modules file as JS object, use object fields as classname

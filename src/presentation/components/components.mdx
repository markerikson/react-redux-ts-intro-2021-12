#### Components

##### Components === State Machines

React thinks of UIs as simple state machines. By thinking of a UI as being in various states and rendering those states, it's easy to keep your UI consistent. In React, you simply update a component's state, and then render a new UI based on this new state. React takes care of updating the DOM for you in the most efficient way

##### Components === Functions

Just like functions take parameters and return a result, components take in values and return UI output. Given the same input values, a component will return the same UI output. This is often described as `UI = f(state)`

import helloWorld from "./examples/HelloWorldComponent";

console.log(helloWorld);

#### Hello World Component

<ComponentPlayground theme="dark" code={helloWorld} />

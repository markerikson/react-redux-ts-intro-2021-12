#### Learning Resources: React

##### React Docs

- [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) (docs overview and related resources)
- [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) (read the whole series, but especially these two):
  - [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)
  - [Thinking In React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
  - [React Hooks guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) (lays out the motivation, teaches hooks, API reference, in-depth FAQ)

The React docs still teach classes in the tutorials. A rewrite is in progress (first beta due early 2021), but until then, there's a "React with Hooks" version of the React docs that uses hooks and function components for all examples:

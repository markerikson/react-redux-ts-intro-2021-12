#### Redux Core Docs Rewrite

- Problems with current docs ([Issue #2590: General docs review](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/2590))
  - Originally written 3 years ago, to target a different audience
    - [Dan Abramov on Twitter, 2015: "so hard to write the new docs - many audiences to cater to. Flux beginners, FP people, normal JS people"](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/622567874796855296)
    - Assumptions about "Flux wars"
    - Comparisons to things like Backbone
  - Tutorials are shallow and don't get into "real-world" usage
  - Unclear learning flow
  - "Recipes" section is a bunch of random content
  - "Usage with React" page emphasizes "containers" unnecessarily
  - Lack of info on _why_ and _when_ you should use Redux
  - Deliberately unopinionated almost everywhere

#### Redux Core Docs Rewrite
  
- Planned docs revamp ([Issue #3313: Revamped docs content, structure, and teaching flow](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3313)):
  - Reorganize current content into more logical structures
  - Provide "learning paths" for different types of users
  - Rework tutorials
    - Clarify how Redux works, from bare-bones up to large apps
    - Switch from "folder-by-type" to "feature folder" structures
  - More info on how to use Redux with (and without) various UI frameworks
    - Rewrite "Usage with React" tutorial
  - "Style Guide" page with opinionated suggestions and best practices
  - New "Real-World Usage" section
    - Discuss app structures, async, selectors, etc

#### New "Redux Essentials" Tutorial
  
- Spent first half of 2020 writing a new 25K-word "Redux Essentials" tutorial sequence
  - Teaches Redux Toolkit and React-Redux hooks as the default way to use Redux 
  - Uses a "top-down" / "how to use it the right way" teaching approach
  - Builds a "real-world" example app that teaches Redux concepts and covers all of the RTK and React-Redux APIs
- Took inspiration from numerous other docs sites and tutorials
  - "What You'll Learn / What You've Learned" summaries
  - Info/Tip/Caution/Warning callout boxes and "Detailed Explanation" expandable sections 
  - Diagrams and embedded runnable CodeSandboxes
- Now linked as the default "Tutorial" on the header 

##### [Redux Essentials, Part 1: Overview and Concepts](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts)

---

#### New "Redux Fundamentals" Tutorial
  
- Existing "Basics/Advanced" tutorial has many flaws ([issue #855](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3855)):
  - Outdated references to "Flux", etc
  - Unclear code examples
  - Shows practices we no longer recommed ( `/reducers` folder, "container components", `const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'`)
- Currently writing a new "Redux Fundamentals" tutorial to replace the "Basics" sequence
  - Still need a low-level, "how the mechanics work" tutorial sequence that shows writing Redux code "by hand"
  - Covers same concepts (actions, reducers, store, usage with React, async), but rewrites 90% of the content 
  - Shows single-file "slice file" pattern, React-Redux hooks, `"todos/todoAdded"` types
  - Adds overview of Redux concepts, standard usage patterns, and finishes by showing how RTK simplifies the existing hand-written Redux logic
  - Real working example todo app, with CodeSandboxes
- Current draft about 50% done (possible ETA end of October?)


##### [Redux Fundamentals, Part 1 (preview): Overview](https://deploy-preview-3894--redux-docs.netlify.app/tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview)


---

#### Redux Style Guide 

- Lists official "opinionated" patterns and practices 
- "Essential":
  - no mutation
  - no side effects in reducers
  - one store
- "Strongly Recommended": 
  - Use RTK
  - Structure logic as "ducks/slice" files
  - More logic in reducers
  - Model actions as "events", not "setters"
  - Use React-Redux hooks
  - Use static typing
  - Use plain JS objects, not Immutable.js
- "Recommended":
  - Write actions as `"domain/eventName"`
  - Use Flux Standard Action structure 
  - Use thunks for async

#### Other Docs Needs

- React-Redux docs work:
  - Tutorial still teaches `connect` as default
  - Needs a hooks usage guide page
- Redux Toolkit docs work:
  - Tutorials need to be rethought to balance teaching RTK vs Redux concepts 
  - Tutorial content on migration and using TS should be moved to new pages
